## Model Description


* A population of 40-year old women are at risk for both secular death and an indication (A) that happens at a 10% rate over a 10-year period.
* All those who experience the event incur a cost of $10,000.
* Those who experience the event experience a 0.05 utility decrement for 1 year, and are placed on a drug for life that costs $0.5/day.
* There is an adverse event (B) that occurs downstream of indication A, with probability 0.02 over a 1-year period.
* Adverse Event B has a 5% case fatality rate with a $15,000 cost among the decedents and, among the survivors, incurs a $25,000 cost and a 0.1 disutility for life.
* There is a test available that, if the person tests positive for increased risk (prevalence is 0.2), results in an alternative drug (for life) that costs $5/day but reduces the rate of the second event by a relative risk of 0.7.
* Indication and adverse events are not recurrent.
* We are going to compare two strategies: "Reference" (no testing) vs “Testing” (Testing at the time of indication A).
* Standard annual discounting of 0.03 applies.

### Indication

```{r compare_ind}

deq <- deq_simulation(params)


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# Overlay Indicate by DES and DEQ

     ylab='Percent Population', xlab="t (year)",
     main="Indication Disutility", ylim=c(0, 1.1))

                count=c(rep(1,  length(des$indication)),

x$count <- cumsum(x$count)
lines(x$time/365, 100*x$count/params$n, col='red', lty=2)
```

```{r compare_deaths}

```

## Compare End Results


```{r results}
rbind(des=des_summary(des, params),
      deq=deq_summary(deq, params))

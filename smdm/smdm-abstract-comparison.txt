There are multiple methods available to researchers in cost effectiveness analysis each with their own advantages and disadvantages. We compare three common methods for estimating incremental cost effectiveness in a health care setting: Markov model cohort simulation, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and differential equations for their biases, error, and trade offs in a simple model. This model examines the effect of genomic testing for medication response that changes relative risk of a rare but costly complication in the treatment of a condition. In particular rare events with competing risks lead to difficulties in accurate estimation. A common technique of rescaling time step in Markov modeling leads to bias, especially with rare events. Further the Markov method requires compromises in construction over the DES and differential methods. In DES simulations, the digits of accuracy scale with the logarithm of the number of trajectories (individuals) simulated, and with rare events this necessitates a lot of computer CPU time. Differential equations modeling handles rare events quite well, but is the most difficult for a modeler to construct. Overall we've found that each of the methods are useful but it is worth understanding their limitations and applicability in differing cost effectiveness decision making scenarios.
